# nodejs-learning-path

I've made this repo to store all code stuff related to my nodejs learning path.

I have a notion of all notes taken of all courses that I've watched
or documentations read, you can watch it in this [notion site](https://aguilarkevin.notion.site/aguilarkevin/Nodejs-from-Scratch-287b03b544c84080908080617ca2d673)
